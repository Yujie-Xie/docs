# Lark interaction for support tickets

For customers subscribed to the **Premium** support plan, we provide a ticket bot called **PingCAP Support Bot** to support more comprehensive interaction and management of support tickets.

## Interaction for Support Tickets

If Interaction for Support Tickets is enabled, **PingCAP Support Bot** will convert the **Support Ticket Created** message card to a thread to manage ticket interactions.

When a PingCAP support engineer comments on the ticket, the comment will be automatically synced to the thread.
