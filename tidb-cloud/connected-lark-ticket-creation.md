# Lark ticket creation and update subscription

For customers subscribed to the Enterprise support plan, we provide **PingCAP Support Bot** to manage ticket creation and updates from the support ticket system.

## Ticket Creation

In the Customer Support Group lark group, type `@PingCAP Support Bot create ticket` in a message. Then, **PingCAP Support Bot** will reply with a Lark message card for ticket creation.

Fill in the required fields and click `Submit`. Once submitted, the card will be updated to **Ticket Submitted**, indicating that your request is being processed.

After the support ticket is created, the **Ticket Submitted** card will be updated to the **Support Ticket Created** card, providing the ticket name and a link to view the ticket.

## Ticket Update Subscriptions

Whenever a PingCAP support engineer comments on the ticket, **PingCAP Support Bot** will send a **New Comment on Your Ticket** card to the Lark group.

## FAQs

1. How can I check the status of my ticket?

Log in to the [customer portal](https://tidb.support.pingcap.com/servicedesk/customer/user/requests) with the email address used to create the ticket. You can view all historical tickets and their status for the current account.
