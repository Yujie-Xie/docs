# Announcing the New Generation of TiDB Cloud Support Services - Connected Care

As customers of all sizes continue to scale their use cases and operations on TiDB Cloud, TiDB Cloud is committed to re-imagine its support services to accommodate their evolving needs. To deliver even greater value and seamless experiences, TiDB Cloud is excited to announce the launch of the next-generation support services, **Connected Care**, on Feb 15, 2025.

As part of this transition, the current support plan offerings will no longer be available for purchase starting from the launch date of the Connected Care services. However, TiDB Cloud will continue to provide full support to customers subscribing to legacy plans until their respective [retirement dates](#legacy-plans-replacement-and-retirement).

To ensure a smooth transition and access to the latest features, TiDB Cloud encourages customers to transit and adopt the Connected Care services.

## Connected Care

The new Connected Care support services are designed to bring the following benefits:

- Connect **Enterprise** and **Premium** plan customers with modern communication tools and advanced AI capabilities, delivering an enhanced and seamless customer experience.
- Connect **Basic** plan customers with the vibrant TiDB community, fostering closer engagement and interaction.

There are four support plans: **Basic**, **Developer** (corresponding to the legacy **Standard** plan), Enterprise, and Premium. Customers from all four have access to the [PingCAP support portal](https://tidb.support.pingcap.com/) for service requests. Advanced features such as Technical Account Managers and [Placeholder] are also available.
The following is an overview of Connected Care services. See the [full details here](/tidb-cloud/connected-care-detail.md).

## Legacy Plans replacement and retirement

In the new Connected Care services, although **Basic**, **Enterprise**, and **Premium** support plans use the same names as those in legacy plans, they refer to different plans with different service commitments.

Once a legacy support plan shuts down, TiDB Cloud will no longer support it. If you does transition to any support plan in Connected Care by the relevant shutdown date, you will be automatically transitioned to the **Basic** support plan in Connected Care.
The following table lists the shutdown schedules for the legacy support plans:

| Support plans                        | Shutdown date |
|:----------------------------------------|:--------------|
| Legacy **Basic** plan                     | Feb 15, 2025  |
| Legacy **Standard** plan                           | Feb 15, 2025  |
| Legacy **Enterprise** and **Premium** plans | Jan 15, 2026  |

## FAQs

### What's the difference between the legacy services and the new Connected Care services?

The support plans in the new Connected Care services provide better connectivity, more personalized support, and cost-effective solutions for different customer needs.

- New **Enterprise** and **Premium** plans: A completely new set of features designed to help customers stay more 'Connected' is now available. These features include Clinic advanced monitoring service, IM subscription for Cloud alerts, IM subscription for ticket updates, AI chat in IM, and IM interaction for support tickets.

- **Developer** plan: customers benefit from access to the same community and AI assistance as the **Basic** plan, while also enjoying a reduced subscription fee starting at $29 (decreased from $49 for the legacy **Standard** service)

- New **Basic** plan: customers will be guided to join the active community channels, where they can engage with other community members and interact with an AI bot for technical assistance.

### How do I check my current support plan?

Visit the [Support](https://tidbcloud.com/console/org-settings/support) page in the TiDB Cloud console. Your current support plan is displayed in the upper-left area of the page.

### Do I need to pay more for similar services?

While the new Connected Care services offer a more comprehensive and feature-rich support experience, the pricing remains closely aligned to the previous offerings. TiDB Cloud remains dedicated to delivering added value to better support your journey.

### How can I get technical support after the legacy **Basic** plan shuts down?

You can still access Billing and Account support. For technical support, consider purchasing a support plan in the Connected Care services. It is recommended that you start with the **Developer** plan, which includes a one-month free trial.
