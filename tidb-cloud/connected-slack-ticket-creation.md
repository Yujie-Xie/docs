# Slack ticket creation and update subscription

For customers subscribed to the **Enterprise** support plan, we provide a ticket bot called **PingCAP Support Bot**, to support quick ticket creation.

## Ticket Creation

In the Slack support channel, you only need to mention **PingCAP Support Bot** and describe the problem in a message. Then, the ticket bot will respond with a thread containing a `Raise Request` button.

Click the `Raise request` button to open a form, fill it out according to the problem, and then click `Create` to submit the ticket.

## Ticket Update Subscriptions

The **Enterprise** support plan supports subscriptions to ticket updates in Slack. When a support engineer responds to a ticket, a ticket update message will appear in the Slack channel. The message includes information such as the ticket title, ticket link, and last comment content.
